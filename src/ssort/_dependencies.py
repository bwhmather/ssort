    Constructs a graph of the hard dependencies within a list of class level

    without changing the semantics of the script.

    At inititialisation, class level statements can see earlier bindings in the
    class body.

    Note that this isn't a proper scope: variables from the containing scope are
    not shadowed until after a binding is actually made and, obviously from the
    need for a `self` argument, bindings are not captured.

    The following example demonstrates some of this behaviour:

    .. code:: python

        >>> r = 1
        >>> class A:
        ...     a = r
        ...     r = 2
        ...     b = r
        >>> r
        1
        >>> A.a
        1
        >>> A.b
        2

    resolved at the module level and don't emit any warning.
